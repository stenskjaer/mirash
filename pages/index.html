    In February 1974 the Albanian epic singer Mirash Ndou spent a
    week in the Albturist hotel in Shkodra performing the most
    important parts of his repertoire to the tape-recorder. The
    present resource contains his songs both sung and dictated, as
    well as his own comments on his art.
